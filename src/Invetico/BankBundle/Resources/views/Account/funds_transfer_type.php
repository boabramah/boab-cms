                <li>Transactions you make on business days before 6:00pm will be preocessed by us the same day</li>
                <li>Transactions made at all other times will be processed by us the next business day.</li>
                <li>Payments to third parties (such as utility bills and non-RBC credit cards) often need 
                    more processing time by the third party -- which generally takes up to 3 business days. 
                    It's a good idea to check with these third parties to find out how far in advance you 
                    should make the payments in order to meet their due date.</li>
